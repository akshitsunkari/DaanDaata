# DaanDaata

In a world where food delivery apps thrive—what about those who can’t afford a meal? Daan Daata is a vision to bridge that gap, creating a self-sustaining food-sharing network where surplus food is redistributed instead of wasted. Built with a peer-to-peer model, it enables direct, real-time coordination between donors and recipients, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
